# Expense Tracker CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) built with Node.js to help you track your daily expenses. This tool allows you to add, update, delete, and summarize expenses directly from your terminal using commands and options. Itâ€™s a lightweight project designed to practice working with files, CLI arguments, and user input using the Commander.js library.
